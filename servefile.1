.SH DISCLAIMER
Do not use this as a normal webserver. This server is optimized for running
a short time and to send files to other people, not for doing performant
static file serving.

.SH DESCRIPTION
servefile is a small HTTP-server indented for transitional file transfer
mostly in the local network. It aims to make transfer of single files as
painless as possible.

Without any options servefile serves just one file and redirects all HTTP
requests to that one file.

Uploads can be done with curl, wget (see EXAMPLES) or a normal browser.
In upload mode with \fI\-u\fR servefile creates a directory and saves all
uploads into that directory. When uploading with curl or wget the filename
is taken out of the path part of the url used for the upload.

For SSL support python-openssl (pyssl) needs to be installed. If no key and
cert is given, servefile will generate a keypair for you and display its
fingerprint.
